            After reaching a peak in price late 2017 and subsequently fading
            from popularity, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have experienced a
            more modest surged once again in 2019. As this has taken place, so
            too have the number of publicized hacking events increased as well.
            Given that many investors are new to the system and may not know how
            to keep their investments secure, hackers are coming up with
            ingenious ways of stealing funds. Some of the most prominent thefts
            have been those that have taken place in plain sight: some hacks
            even blatantly reroute tokens bound for one wallet for another. The
            victims watch as their tokens are stolen away from them, with
            nothing they can do about it.

              Cold storage (or offline wallets) is one of the safest methods for
              holding bitcoin, as these wallets are not accessible via the
              Internet.

              Just the way we keep cash or cards in a physical wallet, bitcoins
              are also stored in a wallet—a digital wallet. The digital wallet
              can be hardware-based or web-based. The wallet can also reside on
              a mobile device, on a computer desktop, or kept safe by printing
              the private keys and addresses used for access on paper. But how
              safe are any of these digital wallets? The answer to this depends
              on how the user manages the wallet. Every wallet contains a set of
              private keys without which the bitcoin owner cannot access the
              currency. The biggest danger in bitcoin security is the individual
              user perhaps losing the private key or having the private key
              stolen. Without the private key, the user will never see her
              bitcoins again. Besides losing the private key, a user can also
              lose her bitcoin by computer malfunctions (crashing a hard drive),
              by hacking, or by physically losing a computer where the digital
              wallet resides.
            </p>
            <p>
              Below, we'll take a look at some of the best ways to store bitcoin
              safely.
            </p>
            <br />
            <b>Desktop Wallet</b>
            <p>
              Desktop wallets are those that are not connected to the Internet;
              they are also referred to as "cold storage" methods. A desktop
              wallet offers a number of advantages over an online wallet. While
              online wallets are easily accessed from anywhere in the world,
              they are also more vulnerable to potential hacking. Desktop
              wallets, on the other hand, are accessed only via your private
              computer, with personal security keys stored just on that machine.
              Thus, exposure of your security key online is dramatically
              reduced. Nonetheless, desktop wallets are still susceptible to
              hacks if your machine gets infected with malware designed to root
              out keys and steal Bitcoins.
            </p>
            <br />
            <b>Hardware Wallet</b>
            <p>
              More secure than a desktop wallet is a hardware wallet. These
              wallets are bits of hardware, external devices like USB sticks
              which you can carry around on your person. An added benefit of a
              hardware wallet is the complete anonymity with which you can
              transact. There is no personal information linked to the hardware,
              so no identifying data which could be leaked. Hardware wallets are
              resilient to malware, and if you happen to lose the wallet you'll
              be able to recover the funds using a seed phrase. On the other
              hand, if you lose the hardware wallet, there is no other way of
              recovering your bitcoin.
            </p>
            <br />
            <b>Paper Wallet</b>
            <p>
              A paper wallet is also a relatively safe way of storing Bitcoin,
              although it requires a bit more advanced understanding of how
              digital currencies work. Generate a paper wallet online using any
              number of dedicated websites, or generate the wallet offline for
              even greater security. Paper wallets are stored easily because
              they don't take up a great deal of space, and they also offer true
              anonymity: they are simply a Bitcoin seed written in some way on a
              piece of paper.
            </p>
            <br />
            <b>Physical Coins</b>
            <p>
              Services are cropping up which allow Bitcoin investors to buy
              physical Bitcoins. The coin you purchase will have a tamper-proof
              sticker covering a predetermined amount of Bitcoin. In order to
              purchase the physical coin, you may need to pay a slight premium
              over the value of the Bitcoin that you're buying, owing to the
              cost of the manufacture and shipment of the coin itself.
            </p>
            <br />
            <b>Other Security Precautions</b>
            <h4>Backup</h4>
            Backup your entire bitcoin wallet early and often. In case of a
            computer failure, a history of regular backups may be the only way
            to recover the currency in the digital wallet. Make sure to backup
            all the wallet.dat files and then store the backup at multiple
            secure locations (like on a USB, on the hard drive, and on CDs). Not
            only this, set a strong password on the backup.
            <p />
            <br />
            <h4>Software Updates</h4>
            Keep your software up to date. A wallet running on non-updated
            bitcoin software can be a soft target for hackers. The latest
            version of wallet software will have a better security system in
            place thereby increasing the safety of your bitcoins. If your
            software is updated with the latest security fixes and protocol, you
            may evade a big crisis because of the enhanced security of the
            wallet. Consistently update your mobile device or computer operating
            systems and software to make your bitcoins safer.
            <p />
            <br />
            <h4>Multi-Signature</h4>
            The concept of a multi-signature has gained some popularity; it
            involves an approval from a number of people (say 3 to 5) for a
            transaction to take place. Thus this limits the threat of theft as a
            single controller or server cannot carry out the transactions (i.e.,
            sending bitcoins to an address or withdrawing bitcoins). The people
            who can transact are decided in the beginning and when one of them
            wants to spend or send bitcoins, they require others in the group to
            approve the transaction.

              A bitcoin exchange acts as the intermediary between a seller and a
              buyer or, to use cryptocurrency language, between a "maker" and a
              "taker."
            </li>
            <li>
              A bitcoin exchange works like a brokerage, and you can deposit
              money via bank transfer, wire, and other common means of deposit.
              However, you will often pay a price for this service.
            </li>
            <li>
              If a trader wants to trade between cryptocurrencies, they will pay
              a currency conversion fee, similar to institutional banks when you
              trade money from different countries.
            </li>
            <li>
              Purchases and sales are based on the same ordering system as
              existing brokerages, where a buyer (taker) places a limit order
              which is then sold when a corresponding cryptocurrency is
              available from the seller (maker).

            <p>
              Bitcoin exchange platforms match buyers with sellers. Like a
              traditional stock exchange, traders can opt to buy and sell
              bitcoin by inputting either a market order or a limit order. When
              a market order is selected, the trader is authorizing the exchange
              to trade his coins for the best available price in the online
              marketplace. With a limit order set, the trader directs the
              exchange to trade coins for a price below the current ask or above
              the current bid, depending on whether they are buying or selling.
            </p>
            <p>
              To transact in bitcoin on an exchange, a user has to register with
              the exchange and go through a series of verification processes to
              authenticate his or her identity. Once the authentication is
              successful, an account is opened for the user who then has to
              transfer funds into this account before he or she can buy coins.
            </p>
            <p>
              Different exchanges have different payment methods that can be
              used for depositing funds including bank wires, direct bank
              transfers, credit or debit cards, bank drafts, money orders and
              even gift cards. A trader who would like to withdraw money from
              his or her account could do so using the options provided by his
              exchange which could include a bank transfer, PayPal transfer,
              check mailing, cash delivery, bank wire, or credit card transfer.

            <br />
            <b>Fees</b>
            <p>
              Making deposits and withdrawals comes at a price, depending on the
              payment method chosen to transfer funds. The higher the risk of a
              chargeback from a payment medium, the higher the fee. Making a
              bank draft or wiring money to the exchange has a lesser risk of a
              chargeback compared to funding your account with PayPal or a
              credit/debit card where the funds being transferred can be
              reversed and returned to the user upon his/her request to the
              bank.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to transaction fees and funds transfer fees, traders
              may also be subject to currency conversion fees, depending on the
              currencies that are accepted by the bitcoin exchange. If a user
              transfers Canadian dollars to an exchange that only deals in U.S.
              dollars, the bank or the exchange will convert the CAD to USD for
              a fee. Transacting with an exchange that accepts your local
              currency is the best way to avoid the FX fee.
            </p>
            <p>
              All bitcoin exchanges have transaction fees that are applied to
              each completed buy and sell order carried out within the exchange.
              The fee rate is dependent on the volume of bitcoin transactions
              that is conducted.
            </p>
            <br />
            <b>Bitcoin Wallets</b>
            <p>
              Note that a bitcoin exchange is different from a bitcoin wallet.
              While the former offers a platform through which bitcoin buyers
              and sellers can transact with each other, the latter is simply a
              digital storage service for bitcoin holders to store their coins
              securely. To be more technical, bitcoin wallets store private keys
              which are used to authorize transactions and access the bitcoin
              address of a user. Most bitcoin exchanges provide bitcoin wallets
              for their users, but may charge a fee for this service.
            </p>
            <br />
            <b>Makers and Takers</b>
            <p>
              Online bitcoin marketplaces usually designate bitcoin participants
              as either makers or takers. When a buyer or seller places a limit
              order, the exchange adds it to its order book until the price is
              matched by another trader on the opposite end of the transaction.
              When the price is matched, the buyer or seller who set the limit
              price is referred to as a maker. A taker is a trader who places a
              market order that immediately gets filled.
            </p>
            <br />
            <b>Example of a Bitcoin Exchange</b>
            <p>
              For example, on a bitcoin exchange, three coin sellers are asking
              for BTC/USD 2265.75, BTC/USD 2269.55, and BTC/USD 2270.00. A
              trader who initiates a market order to buy bitcoins will have
              their order filled at the best ask price of $2265.75. If only five
              bitcoins are available for the best ask and 10 coins are available
              for $2269.55, and the trader wants to buy 10 at market price, the
              trader's order will be filled with 5 coins @ $2265.75 and the
              remaining 5 @ $2269.55.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, a trader who thinks they can get bitcoins for a better
              price could set a limit order for, say, $2260.10. If a seller
              matches their ask price with this order or sets a price below this
              figure, the order will get filled. All of this is done by the
              exchange, which takes a percentage of each transaction for their
              business.

              Before you consider whether to trade forex using bitcoin, it's
              helpful to understand how a conventional forex trade works.
            </p>
            <p>
              A forex trade is simply an exchange of one currency for another at
              its current rate. Unlike tourists who exchange their home currency
              for local spending money, forex traders are trying to make money
              off the continual fluctuations in the real value of one currency
              against another.
            </p>
            <br />
            <b>Trading a 'Pair'</b>
            <p>
              Imagine you are an American trader betting that the British pound
              will lose value compared to the U.S. dollar. This is called
              trading on the British pound/U.S. dollar currency pair (GBP/USD).
            </p>
            <p>
              You deposit $100 with a forex broker. Assuming the rate of $1 =
              £0.5, you will receive £50 for your $100. If the GBP/USD rate
              changes to 0.45, you close the position to 50/0.45 = $111.11. That

              Most forex trading is conducted in a decentralized fashion via
              over-the-counter markets. However, the fact that the forex market
              is decentralized and that bitcoin is considered to be a
              decentralized digital currency does not mean that the two are
              equivalent.

            <b>The Impact of Decentralization</b>
            <p>
              The key distinction is that, though forex exchanges might be
              decentralized, the currencies themselves are backed by central
              banks in the countries that issue them. It's the job of those
              banks to stabilize the value of their currencies and keep them
              stable.

            <p>
              Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies do not have that support.

              In the past year or so, many analysts and others in the world of
              economics have predicted a recession. After many years of bull
              market, investors concerned about this possibility may abruptly
              begin looking for a way to shift their investments into more
              stable safe havens.

            <p>
              The traditional move would be to hedge against stock volatility
              with gold. This has proven an effective method in the past, but a
              newer alternative is challenging the old-school safe-haven.
              Launched in 2009, bitcoin ushered in a new era of digital
              currencies. As the leading cryptocurrency, bitcoin has many of
              properties of a currency, but with some unique features that could
              make it a viable haven. Ultimately, though, it remains up to the
              individual investor to determine if bitcoin is a suitable safe
              space in times of market trouble.

            <p>Below, we'll compare gold and bitcoin as safe haven options.</p>

            <p>
              There are several factors that make gold a strong safe-haven
              asset. It’s valuable as a material for consumer goods such as
              jewelry and electronics, and it is scarce. Regardless of demand,
              supply remains disproportionately low. Gold cannot be manufactured
              like a company issues new shares, or a federal bank prints money.
              It must be dug up from the ground and processed.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Accordingly, gold has almost no correlation with assets like
              currencies, and stock indices such as the S&P 500. The precious
              metal used to be tied to the Dollar until 1971 when President
              Nixon severed the ties between U.S. currency and gold as a base.
              Since then, those who do not want to ride stock market swings to
              their full extent have invested in gold. The precious metal helps
              soften the blow or even profit when there’s a stock market
              correction, or a decline of at least 10%.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              Gold usually performs well during corrections because even if it
              doesn’t necessarily rise, an asset that remains static while
              others decline is quite useful as a hedge. Plus, as more people
              flee stocks and invest in gold, the price rises accordingly.

              Bitcoin is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency that shares some
              properties with its gold counterpart. In fact, many have called
              bitcoin “digital gold” in the past due to its weak relationship
              with all other assets—stocks especially. Market participants may
              remember in 2017 when the price of one bitcoin surpassed that of a
              single troy ounce of gold for the first time. As of January 2020,
              bitcoin’s price is above $8,700, but how is it so valuable? More
              importantly, should those running from stocks consider investing
              in the cryptocurrency?
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Like gold, there is a limited amount of bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto,
              the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, limited the total supply to
              21 million tokens. Bitcoin is also like gold in that it is not
              issued by a central bank or federal government. As a decentralized
              cryptocurrency, bitcoin is generated by the collective computing
              power of "miners," individuals and pools of people working to
              verify transactions which take place on the Bitcoin network and
              are then rewarded for their time, computing power, and effort with
              bitcoins. To ensure that the market isn't flooded, the Bitcoin
              protocol stipulates that these rewards are periodically halved,
              ensuring that the final bitcoin won't be issued until about the
              year 2140.

          <>
            <p>
              For hundreds of years, gold has dominated the safe-haven asset
              arena, while bitcoin was launched just over a decade ago and has
              only achieved widespread recognition in the last few years. Below,
              we'll compare these two investment options head-to-head:
            </p>
            <br />

            <b>1. Transparency, Safety, Legality</b>
            <p>
              Gold’s established system for trading, weighing and tracking is
              pristine. It’s very hard to steal it, to pass off fake gold, or to
              otherwise corrupt the metal. Bitcoin is also difficult to corrupt,
              thanks to its encrypted, decentralized system and complicated
              algorithms, but the infrastructure to ensure its safety is not yet
              in place. The Mt. Gox disaster is a good example of why bitcoin
              traders must be wary. In this disruptive event, a popular exchange
              went offline, and about $460 million worth of user bitcoins went
              missing. Many years later, the legal ramifications of the Mt. Gox
              situation are still being resolved.3﻿ Legally, there are few
              consequences for such behavior, as bitcoin remains difficult to
              track with any level of efficiency.
            </p>
            <br />

            <b>2. Rarity</b>
            <p>
              Both gold and bitcoin are rare resources. The halving of Bitcoin's
              mining reward ensures that all 21 million Bitcoin will be out in
              circulation by the year 2140. While we know that there is only 21
              million bitcoin that exist, It is unknown when all the world's
              gold will be mined from the earth. There is also speculation that
              gold can be mined from asteroids, and there are even some
              companies looking to do this in the future.
            </p>
            <br />

            <b>3. Baseline Value</b>
            <p>
              Gold has historically been used in many applications, from luxury
              items like jewelry to specialized applications in dentistry,
              electronics, and more. In addition to ushering in a new focus on
              blockchain technology, bitcoin itself has tremendous baseline
              value as well. Billions of people around the world lack access to
              banking infrastructure and traditional means of finance like
              credit. With bitcoin, these individuals can send value across the
              globe for close to no fee. Bitcoin's true potential as a means of
              banking for those without access to traditional banks has perhaps
              yet to be fully developed.
            </p>
            <br />

            <b>4. Liquidity</b>
            <p>
              Both gold and bitcoin have very liquid markets where fiat money
              can be exchanged for them.
            </p>
            <br />

            <b>5. Volatility</b>
            <p>
              One major concern for investors looking toward bitcoin as a safe
              haven asset is its volatility. One need look only to the price
              history of bitcoin in the last two years for evidence. At its
              highest point, around the beginning of 2018, bitcoin reached a
              price of about $20,000 per coin. About a year later, the price of
              one bitcoin hovered around $4,000. It has since recovered a
              portion of those losses, but is nowhere near its one-time high
              price point.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              Besides overall volatility, bitcoin has historically proven itself
              to be subject to market whims and news. Particularly as the
              cryptocurrency boom swept up a number of digital currencies into
              record-high prices around the end of 2017, news from the digital
              currency sphere could prompt investors to make quick decisions,
              sending the price of bitcoin upward or downward quickly. This
              volatility is not inherent to gold for reasons mentioned above,
              making it perhaps a safer asset.
            </p>
            <p>
              In recent years, a number of alternative cryptocurrencies have
              launched which aim to provide more stability than bitcoin. Tether,
              for instance, is one of these so-called "stablecoins." Tether is
              linked with the U.S. dollar in much the same way that gold was
              prior to the 1970s. Investors looking for less volatility than
              bitcoin may wish to actually look elsewhere in the digital
              currency space for safe havens.

              Due to the unique nature of virtual currencies, there are some
              inherent advantages to transacting through bitcoin over fiat
              currencies. Although over a decade old, the digital currency
              landscape is constantly changing, with most tokens being untested
              as a medium of exchange, and users should be careful to weigh
              their benefits and risks. That said, bitcoin is designed to offer
              users a unique set of advantages over other payment methods. We'll
              take a closer look at those below, but before we do, it will be
              useful to explore what bitcoin is. By better understanding how
              bitcoin was designed, it will be easier to see what the advantages
              of using bitcoin for payments are.

            <p>
              Bitcoin is a decentralized, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency system
              designed to allow online users to process transactions through
              digital units of exchange called bitcoins (BTC). Started in 2009
              by a mysterious entity named Satoshi Nakamoto, the Bitcoin network
              has come to dominate and even define the cryptocurrency space,
              spawning a legion of altcoin followers and representing for many
              users an alternative to government flat currencies like the U.S.
              dollar or the euro or pure commodity currencies like gold or
              silver coins.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Why the need for bitcoin in the first place, if there are already
              so many traditional means of making payments? A key element of
              bitcoin is its decentralized status, meaning that it is not
              controlled or regulated by any central authority. This immediately
              distinguishes it from fiat currencies. Bitcoin payments are
              processed through a private network of computers linked through a
              shared ledger. Each transaction is simultaneously recorded in a
              "blockchain" on each computer that updates and informs all
              accounts. The blockchain serves as a distributed ledger and
              obviates the need for any central authority to maintain such
              records.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              Bitcoins are not issued by a central bank or government system
              like fiat currencies. Rather, bitcoins are either "mined" by a
              computer through a process of solving increasingly complex
              mathematical algorithms in order to verify transaction blocks to
              be added to the blockchain, or they are purchased with standard
              national money currencies and placed into a "bitcoin wallet" that
              is accessed most commonly through a smartphone or computer.

              Now that we have seen a brief overview of what bitcoin is, we can
              better understand how this leading cryptocurrency provides
              potential benefits to its users.
            </p>
            <br />

            <b>1. User Autonomy</b>
            <p>
              The primary draw of bitcoin for many users, and indeed one of the
              central tenets of cryptocurrencies more generally, is autonomy.
              Digital currencies allow users more autonomy over their own money
              than fiat currencies do, at least in theory. Users are able to
              control how they spend their money without dealing with an
              intermediary authority like a bank or government.
            </p>
            <br />

            <b>2. Discretion</b>
            <p>
              Bitcoin purchases are discrete. Unless a user voluntarily
              publishes his Bitcoin transactions, his purchases are never
              associated with his personal identity, much like cash-only
              purchases, and cannot easily be traced back to him. In fact, the
              anonymous bitcoin address that is generated for user purchases
              changes with each transaction. This is not to say that bitcoin
              transactions are truly anonymous or entirely untraceable, but they
              are much less readily linked to personal identity than some
              traditional forms of payment.
            </p>
            <br />

            <b>3. Peer-to-Peer Focus</b>
            <p>
              The bitcoin payment system is purely peer-to-peer, meaning that
              users are able to send and receive payments to or from anyone on
              the network around the world without requiring approval from any
              external source or authority.
            </p>
            <br />

            <b>4. Elimination of Banking Fees</b>
            <p>
              While it is considered standard among cryptocurrency exchanges to
              charge so-called "maker" and "taker" fees, as well as occasional
              deposit and withdrawal fees, bitcoin users are not subject to the
              litany of traditional banking fees associated with fiat
              currencies. This means no account maintenance or minimum balance
              fees, no overdraft charges and no returned deposit fees, among
              many others.
            </p>
            <br />

            <b>5. Very Low Transaction Fees for International Payments</b>
            <p>
              Standard wire transfers and foreign purchases typically involve
              fees and exchange costs. Since bitcoin transactions have no
              intermediary institutions or government involvement, the costs of
              transacting are kept very low. This can be a major advantage for
              travelers. Additionally, any transfer in bitcoins happens very
              quickly, eliminating the inconvenience of typical authorization
              requirements and wait periods.

              Like with many online payment systems, bitcoin users can pay for
              their coins anywhere they have Internet access. This means that
              purchasers never have to travel to a bank or a store to buy a
              product. However, unlike online payments made with U.S. bank
              accounts or credit cards, personal information is not necessary to
              complete any transaction.

            <b>7. Accessibility</b>
            <p>
              Because users are able to send and receive bitcoins with only a
              smartphone or computer, bitcoin is theoretically available to
              populations of users without access to traditional banking
              systems, credit cards and other methods of payment.
